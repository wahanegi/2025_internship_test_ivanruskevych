# Internship Test

### Elon Musk has destroyed Twitter and we need you to recreate it!

## Requirements

Create an app like Twitter that shows all tweets on the home page. Users can create tweets, but must create an account and be logged in to do so.

 * Use Ruby on Rails + React, with postgresql as the database
 * Use the devise gem for user signup and authentication
 * Use Rspec for automated tests
 * Users should have to validate their email address before being allowed to create new tweets
 * A tweet should have a maximimum of 255 characters and belong to a user
 * A tweet cannot be blank
 * On the home page tweets should be shown from most recent to oldest

After completing this first phase of work, someone on the Cloverpop Engineering team will review your code, ask for changes, and then give you further instructions for new functionality or changes. This will go on until December 20th.


### Submitting Work

  * All work should be submitted in a separate branch and made into pull requests.
  * Starting out, use your best judgement as to how to segment the work into separate pull requests.
  * Assign each pull request to youself and set the "Reviewers" to `Maryna-Harasko` and `rogergraves`.
  * If we assign "Issues", please attach issues to the pull requests that address them.
  * Each pull request should list the amount of time you spent on it, e.g. `3.25 hours` for 3 hours and 15 minutes.

### Demonstrating Work

You will be provided a Heroku app to post your application to. It's recommended to set the Heroku app to automatically deploy when changes are made to your main or master branch.

## Conditions

  * There should be no collaboration with teammates or other people you know on this project, however you can ask Cloverpop personnel for help.
  * Everything submitted should you written by you alone. Excessive copy and pasting from existing applications or using tools that generate excessive amounts of code is forbidden.
  * Ask in advance for permission if you wish to significantly deviate from the requirements.
  * Do frequent commits instead of few commits with logs of changes. Push your commits to Github at least once per day.

## Appropriate LLM Use

Using LLM for help on debugging something you are stuck in is acceptable. Asking it to generate a lot of code is not. Examples:
  * "What could be causing my application to fail given this log? `Paste of error log` -- **is OK**
  * "Please analyze this Ruby method and give me a critique of without code examples: `paste of method`" -- **is OK**
  * "Please generate Ruby on Rails code for ..." -- **is considered excessive and NOT OK**
  * "Rewrite this controller to make it better: `Paste of a ruby file` -- **is considered excessive and NOT OK**
